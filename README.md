Teleport is a tool that enables you to write interoperable modules across
server and browser without any dependency hassles.

With a rising popularity of JavaScript on the server we got some amazing tools.
[npm] is great example, which allows you to to install and publish [node]
libraries. It also manages dependencies and does some other cool stuff.  
So far only node folks had a pleasure of using it. Teleport is all about
bringing this awesomeness to the browsers.

Writing web applications with teleport is nice & easy it does not gets in the
way and preserves development ergonomics we are so used to: Hit refresh and
see your changes!!
